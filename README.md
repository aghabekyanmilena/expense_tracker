# Expense Tracker (university project)

A simple command-line *Expense Tracker* written in Python that lets you add, view, and save your daily expenses.
It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, decorators, and file handling.

* Add new expenses with amount, category, and description
* View all recorded expenses
* View total spending statistics
* Save expenses to a JSON file and load them automatically on startup
* Prevents invalid input (e.g., negative or non-numeric amounts)
* Includes examples of:

  * Encapsulation using `@property`
  * Custom decorator for logging actions
  * File operations (saving and loading data)

```bash
python3 main.py
```
